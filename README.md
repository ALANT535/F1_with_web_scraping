# F1_with_web_scraping
Uses python to scrape the official website for statistics - specifically the World Driver's Champion and the World Constructers Champion of any year of input.
It first goes to the website of that particular yeat and then scrapes the data itself using BeatifulSoup. This data can further be used as a data source for a POWER BI dashboard in the future.
